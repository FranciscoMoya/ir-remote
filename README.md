# IR-remote

A networked universal ir-remote based on NodeMCU

## About

This project comes from frustration with Broadlink RM line of products.  Hardware is fine, the mobile app is barely bearable, Alexa integration is extremely flaky, products are severely overpriced in EU.

A NodeMCU implementation of an IR remote should be under 10â‚¬.  Redundancy is a must for a dependable system.

## Status

This is just a proof of concept with OTA updates, web based wifi configuration, multi-protocol support.

Still missing the backend for Alexa integration.
